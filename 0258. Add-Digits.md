# Problem Description
```
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
```
### Example 1:
```
Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```
# Code
```java
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        while (num > 9) {
            int copy = num;
            int newNum = 0;
            while (copy != 0) {
                newNum += copy % 10;
                copy /= 10;
            }
            num = newNum;
        }
        return num;
    }
```
