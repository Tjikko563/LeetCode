# Problem Description
```
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
```
### Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 2^31.
### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```
### Constraints:
- **1 <= nums.length <= 10^4**
- **-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1**
# Code
```java
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int hammingDistance = 0;
        String diff = Integer.toBinaryString(x ^ y);
        for (int i = 0; i < diff.length(); i++) {
            if (diff.charAt(i) == '1') {
                hammingDistance++;
            }
        }
        return hammingDistance;
    }
```
