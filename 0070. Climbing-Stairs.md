# Problem Description
```
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
```
### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Constraints:
- **1 <= n <= 45**

# Code
```java
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int[] f = new int[n + 2];
        f[0] = 0;
        f[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n + 1; i++) {
            f[i] = f[i - 1] + f[i - 2];
        }

        return f[n + 1];
    }
```
