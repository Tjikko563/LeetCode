# Problem Description
```
Given integer array nums, return the third maximum number in this array. 
If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.
```
### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```
### Constraints:
- **1 <= nums.length <= 10^4**
- **-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1**
# Code
```java
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (!arr.contains(i)) {
                arr.add(i);
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(arr);
        if (arr.size() < 3) {
            return arr.get(arr.size() - 1);
        }
        return arr.get(arr.size() - 3);
    }
```
